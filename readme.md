# Optic-disc-segmentation-by-U-net-and-probability-bubble
The program in OD-UNET-MASTER uses u-net for rough segmentation of OD, similarly, Vesselsegmentation uses u-net for blood vessel segmentation.



FindOD is a program to obtain the final segmentation result of the video disc after coarse segmentation with u-net through the probabilistic bubble model.vessel aid is a program to obtain the final blood vessel results through the probabilistic bubble model after the blood vessels are roughly segmented with u-net.



vesselvector uses the BVV model for final foveal positioning.



Specific methods can be found in the literature Optic disc segmentation by U-net and probability bubble in abnormal fundus images（https://so1.cljtscd.com/scholar?q=Optic+disc+segmentation+by+U-net+and+probability+bubble+in+abnormal+fundus+images）
